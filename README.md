# PVZ-Rando

Hi I guess if you stumbled along this project this is my side of the project that im documenting at least.  
It's gonna be a slow proscess as I have 0 modding expierence and this will be my first time dabbling in the world of modding any game really.
I intend this to first be a standalone rando and then to add archipelago support whenever I figure it out.
Once I have something working Ill probably make a beta release.  Anyways ill do my best to keep this updated with information but no promises.
